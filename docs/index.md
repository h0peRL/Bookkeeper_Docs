It utilizes a C# ASP.NET Core REST API for the backend functionality, while the frontend will be implemented in a separate project. With Bookkeeper, users can efficiently manage their financial records and perform various bookkeeping operations.

# Why Bookkeeper?

This project was conceived and implemented during our education as Software Engineers in the IMS program at the BBBaden School. Currently in our 3rd Year, we aim to further enhance our skills, focusing on a specific module dedicated to Multi-User applications. This additional module will deepen our understanding for mudlti-user applications. The Bookkeeper project is a great opportunity to apply our knowledge and skills in a real-world scenario.
